## Description <a href="description"></a>

This is a professional nodeJS README generator that uses the command line and a series of prompts to build a README.MD file for your GitHub page.
The README.md file the program generates will be placed in the "readme_files" folder.
You can download the code at this repository: https://github.com/JeffGoji/readme-generator.
See demo/instruction video here: [https://youtu.be/oCDSMqKEUY4](https://youtu.be/oCDSMqKEUY4)

You will need to run “npm install” in the command line to install your dependencies. You will need to Install the [inquirer npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) to make the application work on your computer, you can do so by typing “npm install inquirer” in your command line.

A fun little note, this README file was created with this program.
